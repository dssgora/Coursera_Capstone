# Battle of Neighborhood
## Introduction/Problem Statement:

### Background:
Every individual in today’s world wants to have best living standards and quality of life. We all are so busy now-a-days that we do have enough time to travel from one part of the city to another for our daily needs. Facilities like gymnasiums, nearby schools and colleges, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc. all these adds to our daily necessities. Daily busy schedules and heavy traffics consumes so much of time that we struggle to achieve our daily needs. 


One of the options is to select and reside in a neighborhood which have all or most of the facilities nearby.


One of my friend is looking to settle in a city which provides him better living standards and quality of life. He did his initial analysis and came up with 2 options, Toronto, Canada and New York City, USA. He has asked me for the help to decide one of them. I am doing this project which will analyze neighborhoods between Toronto and New York. It will provide detailed analysis and insight into the neighborhoods and local businesses so that it helps my friend make a decision to understand which city has better facilities and quality of life. This project will also explore the similarities and dissimilarities between neighborhoods in the two cities and help determine which neighborhoods is the best place to settle.


### Target Audience

Although as of now this project is to help my friend make a decision but similar analysis can also be done for any other city of the world to understand the neighborhoods. This can be helpful for any individual just like my friend, any company who is in search of a best location to set up an office so that all the employees working can be benefitted or anyone looking to setup a business related to daily necessity like gymnasium, coffee shop, grocery store, etc.

Foursquare lets users search for restaurants, nightlife spots, shops and other places in a location. It provides personalized recommendations based on factors that include user experience and their venue ratings.
Foursquare API search feature will be used to collect neighborhood venue information. Details about local venues and locality will provide insight into the qualities of a neighborhood.
