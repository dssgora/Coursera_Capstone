# Battle of Neighborhood
## Introduction:
One of my friend is looking to settle in a city which provides him better living standards and quality of life. He did his analysis and came up with 2 options, Toronto, Canada and New York City, USA. now he has asked me for the help to decide one of them. I am doing this project which will analyze neighborhoods between Toronto and New York. It will provide detailed analysis and insight into the neighborhoods and local businesses so that it helps my friend make a decision to understand which city has better facilities and quality of life. This project will also explore the similarities and dissimilarities between neighborhoods in the two cities and help determine which neighborhoods best place to settle.

## Data:
The data to be used for this project will be acquired from the respective cities Wikipedia website pages. The datasets consist of the postal codes, neighborhood names, latitude, and longitude information for each neighborhood. Foursquare API search feature will be used to collect neighborhood venue information. Details about local venues and locality will provide insight into the qualities of a neighborhood. In addition to Foursquare, various python packages will be used to create maps and machine learning models to further provide insights into our neighborhood battle project.
